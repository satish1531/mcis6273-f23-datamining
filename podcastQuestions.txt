Question 1:  List 3 things that you learned from this podcast?
You do not require a lot of math in data science, unless you want to build the next machine learning model.
There is a lot of frameworks and packages to support data science.
The difference between developers and datascientists. Developers majorly dwell on creating robust software systems, 
Data scientists do not value the code, as compared to developers where code is the main end product.

Question 2: What is your reaction to the podcast? Pick at least one point brought up in the interview that you agree with and list your reason why.
The podcast has been educative, I got get more knolwedge to understand python as a data scientis and a developer.
 I like Python and R because it does not require a deep learning curve. It is simple and easier to understand. I agree with this because I personally found out that is is easier to use and implement python codes compared to the other languages because you do not need to define classes and functions.

reason why.
Question 3: After listening to the podcast, do you think you are more informed about the importance of Python to Data Science?
Yes I am very aware of how python has helped a lot of data scientists especially from 2012 where python gathered a lot of users.
How? (Be brief â€“ one sentence will suffice.)
Due to the vast packages python offers, and the way it handles missing values. 
Question 4. List one surprising fact you learned from listening to this podcast.
For data scientists, the dataset should be taken in a lot of consideration, you may be good with the coding and visualisation but, garbaged or disorganised data always lead to incorrect results.
